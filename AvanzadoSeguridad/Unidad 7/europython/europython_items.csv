Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer,July 2020,"With Python, when thinking of web frameworks, two that come into mind are Django and Flask. Instead of having to choose one of the two, this session shows how you can engineer Flask to achieve a simili-Django app. It's a dive into the internal components of Django and the idea behind. The session covers different Flask development patterns to finally finish with an app that's functionally similar to Django with some extra features in for free. It also lists some caveats identified with such a pattern. This session requires attendees to know Flask and having used Django for building at least one project. At the very least it assumes the knowledge of models, views, controller, templates and migrations. It discusses along the way the educational and pedagogical aspect of learning web frameworks and proposes a syllabus. It discusses the benefits of learning Flask and the necessity of learning the two as a Pythonista. Django is the go-to framework for web development and it's no surprise that most freelancing jobs require Django. Flask is appreciated for the flexibility it gives. The session also touches about how we can better promote Flask through education.

Bruno Ferreira,July 2020,"The Corona Virus - COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant impact on public services. In particular, it brought a massive digitalization of services that were offered in person. In addition, there was a great deal of pressure on official channels, whether to seek a service or to report a fact. Qualified and official information becomes an element in combating the pandemic. Knowing where to look for information, reporting a fact or getting a qualified response are essential steps to maximize the efficiency of the citizen's decision-making process, especially in a scenario of such uncertainty. The State has a fundamental role, whether as an inducer, executor or provider of the means necessary for information and decision-making to be effective at that time.,Connected by the growing demand, the State of Goiás, through the State's Comptroller General, published a series of technological tools with the objective of bringing information to the citizen, promoting social control and improving public policies to fight the Coronavirus.,This document seeks to show how technological tools were adopted and implemented in terms of transforming the ombudsman channels in the State of Goiás through the State's Comptroller General in actions to combat the Coronavirus pandemic.

Naoise Holohan,July 2020,"Data privacy is having an ever-increasing impact on the way data is stored, processed, accessed and utilised, as the legal and ethical effects of data protection regulations take effect around the globe. Differential privacy, considered by many to be the strongest privacy guarantee currently available, gives robust, provable guarantees on protecting privacy, and allows tasks to be completed on data with guarantees on the privacy of individuals in that data. This naturally extends to machine learning, where training datasets can contain sensitive personal information, that are vulnerable to privacy attacks on trained models.,By using differential privacy in the training process, a machine learning model can be trained to accurately represent the dataset at large, but without inadvertently revealing sensitive information about an individual. Diffprivlib is the first library of its kind to leverage the power of differential privacy with scikit-learn and numpy to give data scientists and researchers access to the tools to train accurate, portable models with robust, provable privacy guarantees built-in.,In this talk, we will introduce attendees to the idea of differential privacy, why it is necessary in today's world, and how diffprivlib can be seamlessly integrated within existing scripts to protect your trained models from privacy vulnerabilities. Attendees will be expected to have a basic understanding of sklearn (i.e., how to initialise, fit and predict a model).

Having said that,  AsyncIO comes to mind.,While researching similar topics on cloud IoT solutions, we noticed that the vast majority of such solutions primarily includes performance. In this discussion we would like to demonstrate how you can ensure that a low-cost, fast developed cloud IoT core can ensure that its data is not corrupted and is accurate  for the user.,Technically speaking, it is very interesting to analyze how a bucket of async/await tasks can handle (consume or even produce) messages from or to message queues, interact with other (even non pythonic) modules inside the core, manage socket connections and many other functionalities that make Python3.6+ the heart of any IoT core. Note that it is equally important to check imported data with periodic tasks, acquire statistics from devices and sanitize database data in order to ensure data integrity.,Our goal: Firstly, to encourage new developers to get involved with cloud IoT cores and use Python and AsyncIO as the heart of their core.

Francesca Tedeschi,July 2020,"This project contains an open source Python library for image reconstruction in Axial Computed Tomography (TAC), based on the analytical Radon transforms of some classes of phantoms. ,The package is available on GitHub at the following address: ,.,The mathematical phantoms are fictitious images, composed of very simple geometric figures (ellipses, squares and rectangles) that, sampled with the Radon transform allows to build a fictitious signal, called (exact) sinogram.  Using a phantom gives the advantage to test the reconstruction algorithm on a zero-noise data so the error we get is only due to numerical inaccuracies in the algorithm itself. We want to calculate two reconstructed images from the approximated and exact sinograms, obtained applying the iradon function of the Python library scikit-image on both of them. We expect a smaller error on the exact reconstructed image. This turns to be true on continuous regions, but near the discontinuities of the phantom the Gibbs phenomenon prevents us to obtain the same enhancement.","Education,Image Processing,Open-Source,Science,Teaching",The Phantom of Radon

Nicolas Kuhaupt,July 2020,"In time series forecasting we are interested in how the time series is going to continue in the future. This is of high importance in areas like forecasting energy production from renewable resources, forecasting demand of customers or the price of products. Many forecasting algorithms provide only the prediction. However, oftentimes we are also interested in the likelihood of the prediction and how much it may vary. This is what probabilistic forecasting is for. With every forecast, we also obtain an upper and lower bound with certain probabilities. For a long time, probabilistic forecasting was limited to traditional techniques like ARIMA. DeepAR is an algorithm that allows us to combine Deep Learning techniques with probabilistic forecasting. Additionally, in contrast to training a model for each time series individually, DeepAR suggests training one large forecasting model for all related time series. The algorithm was developed by Amazon and is also provided in AWS SageMaker. ,In this talk, we will understand the theoretical basics of DeepAR, have a look at a practical time series example and will demonstrate an implementation. In the end, you will be prepared to get started with your own forecasts.","Data Science,Deep Learning,Machine-Learning,Predictions,Public Cloud (AWS/Google/...)",Probabilistic Forecasting with DeepAR and AWS SageMaker

Anton Chernikov,July 2020,"The technology is to take script written in a high-level language (Python), analyze its inputs/outputs, images or graphs display, other interactions with the user and build connectors to this script from Chat Apps like Slack, Skype, and others. Imagine that you described your skill as a script and gave it to a software robot. And from that moment it is his skill, you and your colleagues can ask him any time to run this skill and give results. As a script author, you don't think about how to connect with different Chat Apps, how to control access, how to monitor that script works fine when colleagues run it, how to save logs, how to balance load if there are too many colleagues running script and so on, our platform does all of this so the author doesn't need to think about what is that software robot, how it works, the platform will understand script by itself. The author just drop script to the platform and tell to the platform which colleagues have the right to run this script.","Best Practice,Community,Operations,Workforce,python",Automate your tasks with Python and publish with Chat Apps
Ruud van der Ham,July 2020,"In the Python landscape, there are several high-end GUI packages. Of course, there’s tkinter which is part of the standard library. And there is wxPython and several versions of Qt. What they share is that they are very flexible but not only have a steep learning curve but also take considerable development effort to realize even a simple user interface.,At the other of the spectrum, there are several design tools that either generate code of a layout structure. In many cases, the functionality is rather limited, though.,Relatively recent, an independent open-source developer (not me) has made a product that tries to bridge the gap between these two worlds: PySimpleGUI. This package runs on top of tkinter, QT for Windows, wxPython and Remi.,In this talk, I want to show the design methodology behind this fascinating product that might change the way people look at GUIs.,I will start with live coding a simple yet not evident program that shows the basic concepts. With this, I will demonstrate the design philosophy.,PySimpleGUI can also be used to implement a user-friendly interface as opposed to command-line interfaces.,From there, I will give an overview of some more elements present in this package.,Finally, I will show a full-featured GUI program with several bells and whistles.","Beginners,General,Human-Machine-Interaction,python",Attractive GUIs with PySimpleGUI

Naomi Ceder,July 2020,"Python communities around the world, large and small are facing loss - from the loss of in person meetups and conferences to the loss of employment and even the potential loss of health and life. As communities we are all confronting uncertainty and unanswered questions. In this talk I would like to reflect on some of those questions. What are communities doing now to preserve a sense of community in the face of this crisis? What might we do and what options will we have for coming events? How can we build and foster community and still keep everyone safe? What challenges might we all face in the future? What sources of support can we find? What are our sources of optimism and hope?","Community,Conferences and Meet-Ups",Staying for the Community: Building Community in the face of Covid-19
Alejandro Saucedo,July 2020,"As the impact of software increasingly reaches farther and wider, our professional responsibility as developers becomes more critical to society. The production systems we design, build and maintain often bring inherent adversities with complex technical, societal and even ethical challenges. The skillsets required to tackle these challenges require us to go beyond the algorithms, and require cross-functional collaboration that often goes beyond a single developer. In this talk we introduce intuitive and practical insights from a few of the core ethics themes in software including Privacy, Equity, Trust and Transparency. We cover their importance, the growing societal challenges, and how organisations such as The Institute for Ethical AI, The Linux Foundation, the Association for Computer Machinery, NumFocus, the IEEE and the Python Software Foundation are contributing to these critical themes through standards, policy advise and open source software initiatives. We finally will wrap up the talk with practical steps that any individual can take to get involved and contribute to some of these great open initiatives, and contribute to these critical ongoing discussions.","Ethics,Machine-Learning",Meditations on First Deployment: A Practical Guide to Responsible Development
